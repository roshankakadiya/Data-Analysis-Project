## Atliq Hardware data

This project depicts ATLIQ HARDWARE's sales insights in INDIA, which sells millions of products each year. To keep track of live sales and revenue/cost, I created a POWER BI report with a dashboard to see what sales have tendencies over the years and months.


## Process
1. Imported already existing sql data into MySQL bench for further analysis to find out unwanted data. Also did initial analysis using SQL queries to get familiar with the data.
2. Then imported data to Power BI to build some dashboard for better visualization.
3. Performed ETL techniques for Data cleaning.
4. Used Power BI knowledge and created dashboard which may help the stakholders to take some decisions for analysis.
5. Created profit analysis and performance insights dashboard using the given data so that viewers can have better understanding of which cities are giving more profits as well as customers from where most profit is gained.
